Java-Based Lecturer Booking and Boot Camp Registration System 

This project is a Java application designed for a university setting, facilitating booking of lecturer slots, and managing a programming boot camp. It caters to four academic departments: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, with additional features for the Technology department.


Departmental Booking System:

-Enables students to book 15-minute consultation slots with lecturers across four departments.

-Handles scheduling complexities and ensures no time slot overlaps.



Boot Camp Registration for Technology Department:

- Offers specialized programming boot camps.

- Incorporates registration requirements, accommodating both internal and external students.



Discount Mechanism for External Students:

- Provides a 25% discount for external students enrolling in full-time programs after attending the boot camp.



Staff Management:

- Manages full-time and part-time staff across all departments.

- Includes additional staff management for boot camp instructors in the Technology department.



Flexible Fee Structure:

- Implements a fee structure for boot camp attendees, with special rates and discounts for external students.



Robust Code Testing:

- Consists of multiple test cases (Test 2, Test 3a, Test 3b, Test 3c) to ensure the robustness of the application.

- Test 3a implements a hierarchy for base classes aligned with class and object diagrams.

- Test 3b tests staff availability and the student booking system.

- Test 3c involves testing the boot camp application process, including fee calculations and discounts.
