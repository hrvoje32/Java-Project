Java-Based Lecturer Booking and Boot Camp Registration System - This project is a Java application designed for a university setting, facilitating booking of lecturer slots, and managing a programming boot camp. It caters to four academic departments: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, with additional features for the Technology department.

Departmental Booking System:
o	Enables students to book 15-minute consultation slots with lecturers across four departments.
o	Handles scheduling complexities and ensures no time slot overlaps.


Boot Camp Registration for Technology Department:
o	Offers specialized programming boot camps.
o	Incorporates registration requirements, accommodating both internal and external students.


Discount Mechanism for External Students:
o	Provides a 25% discount for external students enrolling in full-time programs after attending the boot camp.


Staff Management:
o	Manages full-time and part-time staff across all departments.
o	Includes additional staff management for boot camp instructors in the Technology department.


Flexible Fee Structure:
o	Implements a fee structure for boot camp attendees, with special rates and discounts for external students.


Robust Code Testing:
o	Consists of multiple test cases (Test 2, Test 3a, Test 3b, Test 3c) to ensure the robustness of the application.
o	Test 3a implements a hierarchy for base classes aligned with class and object diagrams.
o	Test 3b tests staff availability and the student booking system.
o	Test 3c involves testing the boot camp application process, including fee calculations and discounts.
